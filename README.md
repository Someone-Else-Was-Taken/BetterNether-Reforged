# BetterNether-Reforged
This is an unofficial, semi unfinished port of Fabric's BetterNether Mod, started by Redd90 and finished/maintained by me.
There will be daily commits tweaking and testing out fixes and implementations of unfinished features. Pushed to CF every few days (Or sooner hopefully)
Pre-Releases in progress.
 

This mod was designed as improvement for the Nether, adding more biomes, plants and materials into it. I've tried to make its content unique and interesting for exploring as also useful.

 

Primal things, that this mod adds:
1. Many new plants to the Nether;
2. New mobs for the Nether;

3. New unique biomes;
4. Non-vertical volumetric biome system (supporting other mods);
5. New materials, recipes, food, tools and items;
6. Ability to farm some materials using plant farms or mob farms;
8. Ability to configure presence of blocks, items, structures, biomes and plant density 


This is an unofficial port, all art credit and a majority of code credit goes out to the BetterNether Team. Fabric Mod

Please do NOT report issues to the official BetterNether team's Discord or Github. To report issues, report them in the Github linked.

Please contact me directly if there are any issues that arise with this port existing.

 

Known Issues and Unfinished Content:
- Nether Cities don't spawn (Now in progress)

- ~~Fireflies aren't implemented (Now in progress)~~

- Caves don't support surface builders

- ~~Modded Mobs don't spawn (Waiting for Fireflies)~~

- ~~Server works now, however it runs into unique crashes. I would recommend LAN for now.~~

 

Mod compatibility:
So far, BetterNether Reforged is compatible with all tested Nether Biome Mods, including Infernal Expansion, Cinderscapes Reforged and Oh The Biomes You'll go.
With this in mind, if there are compatibility issues, report them here rather than to the other mod.

After 100% of content is implemented, this mod will only be maintained for 1.16.5 and 1.18+ 
Remember, these are just betas, things are subject to change and there are sure to be crashes. I would not recommend using this in long-term worlds until release. (Might be more stable than beta_1 though, not sure)
